### Waypoint Averaging with the Garmin GPSMAP 64

There are some quirks in the way the Garmin GPSMAP 64 does waypoint averaging 
which need explanation. Two pages are used in the process: `Waypoint Manager` 
and `Waypoint Averaging`. You should add these pages to your page sequence -

    Menu - Menu - Settings - Page Sequence

Create a new averaged waypoint by positioning over the location and 
selecting *Create Waypoint* from the `Waypoint Averaging` page. 
This creates a new waypoint and immediately starts collecting a sample. 
There is no way to change the waypoint name on the `Waypoint Averaging` 
page. If you need to change the name do it from the `Waypoint Manager`. 

Also, an apparent flaw in the software prevents display of the last 
element of the sorted list of waypoints on the `Waypoint Averaging` page. 
You can work around this by sorting the list by location. From `Waypoint 
Averaging` press -

    Menu - Sort - Nearest

To start another sample select the waypoint from the `Waypoint Averaging` 
page, position the receiver over the location and press *Start*. Always 
check the *Distance to Saved Location* to make sure you have selected the 
correct waypoint for averaging. It's best to collect subsequent samples 
with different satellite constellations. Garmin recommends 90 minutes 
between samples. 

Subsequent samples can also be collected from the `Waypoint Manager`. 
Select a waypoint and press -
 
    Menu - Average Location.
    
You should always start a new averaged waypoint from *Create Waypoint* on the 
`Waypoint Averaging` page. Collecting the initial sample by pressing *Mark* causes 
the first sample to be unaveraged.
